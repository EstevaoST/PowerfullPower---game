# PowerfullPower---game
Just a small game I've created with peolple in game development club, at PUCRS.

The idea behind this game was to explore bullets mechanism on Unity, specialy physics like ricochet and gravity.
Also made it to relax from my final work at PUCRS graduation, so I could only do a small amount of work each week.
